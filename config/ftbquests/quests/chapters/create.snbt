				"These quests will help to guide you through the basics, but ultimately the final products will be up to you and your imagination! Thankfully, there is a robust in-game documentation system called &dPondering&r, which can be accessed by &6holding the “w” key down when hovering over an item&r in your inventory or in JEI. Make sure you aren’t typing in a text field first, though!"
				"To begin with, take this &bWrench&r. You can &6right click on most Create blocks&r to rotate them or alter them in some way. &dWhich side of the block you click on&r determines which way the object rotates. Additionally, you can &6shift right click&r most Create items (and some vanilla, such as levers or hoppers) &ato instantly remove them directly into your inventory&r. An incredibly useful feature!"
